        <i>Modern-day Lagos is now a state in South-Western Nigeria.</i> It is bounded on the west by the Republic of Benin, to the
        north and east by Ogun State with the Atlantic Ocean providing a coastline on the south. Lagos is made up of a
        collection of islands surrounded by creeks that fringe the mouth of the Lagos lagoon on the southwest. It is separated
        from the <u>Atlantic Ocean</u> by a stretch of loosely connected barrier islands and sand spits.

    <h1>Name of Lagos</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Lagos means "lakes" in Portuguese, the language of the first European-settlers known to visit the settlement, then
        already inhabited by the Awori and Bini. [1] From the first contacts with the region until the early 20th century,
        another Portuguese name for the city that was interchangeably used was Onim,[2] finally abandoned in favor of Lagos.
        Another theory is that Lagos was named after the city of the same name in Portugal which at the time was a major
        maritime hub for seafaring activity on the Atlantic Ocean. Although Lagos translates to "lakes" in Portuguese,
        there's no lake in the proximity of Lagos; Lagos is an Island. "Lagos" comes from the Portuguese word
        "Lagodikuramo", (meaning "Calm-water"). Consistent with the serenity of coastal water. And, as usual practice, it
        was the British colonialist Lord Lugard who suggested abbreviating the name to "Lagos" as to rhyme with their tonal
        preference. <sup>[clarification needed][citation needed]</sup>

    <h1>Lagos as a tributary to the Benin Empire</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        From the crowning of Ado as its first Oba, Lagos (then called Eko) served as a major center for slave-trade, from which
        then Oba of Benin Ado and all of his successors for over four centuries supported - until 1841, when Oba Akitoye
        ascended to the throne of Lagos and attempted to ban slave-trading. <br>
        
        Local merchants strongly opposed the intended move, and deposed and exiled the king, and installed Akitoye's brother
        Kosoko as Oba.[3] <br>
        
        At exile in Europe, Akitoye met with British authorities, who had banned slave-trading in 1807, and who therefore
        decided to support the deposed Oba to regain his throne. With the success of the British intervention, in 1851 Akitoye
        was reinstalled as Oba of Lagos. In practical terms, however, British influence over the kingdom had become absolute,
        and ten years later, in 1861, Lagos was formally annexed as a British colony.
