        <p>Before the Portuguese name of Lagos had been adopted, <b>Lagos</b>  initial name was Eko which referred mainly to the Island. The first to settle in Eko were the Aworis.[10] The Awori hunters and fishermen had originally come from Ile-Ife to the coast</p>
        <h3>Postcolonial era</h3>
        <p>Lagos State was created on 27 May, 1967 according to the State Creation and Transitional Provisions Decree No. 14 of 1967, which restructured Nigeria into a Federation of 12 states.[12] Before the issuance of this Decree, Lagos city, which was the 
            country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs.[12] However, Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry were administered by the then Western Region Government.[12] Lagos,
             <i>the city, along with these other towns were captured to create the state of Lagos</i> , with the state becoming fully recognized as a semi-autonomous administrative division on 11 April, 1968.[12] Lagos served the dual role of being the State and Federal
              Capital until 1976, <u>the capital of the State was moved to Ikeja</u> .[12] <i> After the full establishment of the Federal Capital Territory, the seat of the Federal Government was also formally relocated to Abuja on 12 December, 1991. Nevertheless,
                Lagos still remains the financial centre of the country</i>, and also grew to become the most populous city in the state and the country.
